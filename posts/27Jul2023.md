# Workflow to the Metaverse
## Start with a simple easy modified Microverse

Author: Holger Johannes Vogel July 2023

1. Create a GitHub account. This is a free platform where you can store your code and collaborate with others.

2. Fork the croquet.io microverse or gallery repo. This is a plain vanilla Javascript repository that contains the code for a simple Microverse or Gallery (serverless) and buid for collaboration. You can fork this repository into your own and modify, extend, connect,.. it to create your own unique Microverse. Use Github-Pages to let Github run and publish it - only simple client code based and simple.

3. Modify the code in your Github Repo or Drag & Drop. You can add new features to the code, or you can change the way it looks or even behaves - it will account for synchronized state. You can also add static .vers (JSON) objects to the code or drag and drop it into the running Microverse and share it with others immediately, even change dynamics of behavours!

4. Tokenize your own creations and add ons. Once you have modified your own parts of the code, you might want tokenize your creation. This means that you can create NFTs that represent your Microverse. Ensure using an (micro-) IP and (Ricardian) contract based plus scaling and legal compliant Tokenizer Protocol here, giving you all the options to fully own what is yours and also control rights and access.

5. Create portals to other open microverses. You can create portals to other open microverses to connect and that people can easily travel between them.

6. Use open, simple, fixed and compliant protocols on purpose when creating your metaverse. This will ensure that your creation is interoperable with other metaverses. Consider HTTP (HTML + JavaScript), REST, JSON, croquet, mp3, plain vanilla & set in stone Satoshi BSV, ... 


## By following this workflow
you can create and control your own part of the new WEB3 metaverse and fully own and modify that part. You will not be limited by the rules of any one else platform, but you will be able to collaborate with others to create a truly open and decentralized metaverse.
