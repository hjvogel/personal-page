There is near infinite information outside this new individuum and the gap of understanding the world outside is max. If our human brain would be of the size of the entire world, we would \uFFFDknow\uFFFDeverything immidiatly, but would be exactly same thing as the entire world - had to do nothing, nothing to gain - all would be fine. Equilibriums are the death of any new thing, any process that generates new things and information. Information btw is a two folded thing cause the gradient needs to be there &gt; 0 or there is no information.
