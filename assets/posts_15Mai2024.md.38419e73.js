There is near infinite information outside opposing this new individuum and the gap of understanding the world outside is at max. If our human\uFFFDs brain would be of the size of the entire world, we would \uFFFDknow\uFFFDeverything immediately, but would be exactly same thing as the entire world - had to do nothing, nothing to gain - all would be fine and we know everything cause we are everything.</p><p>Equilibriums as such are the death. Any new thing, any process that generates new things and information is not happening or not recognized - nothing gained, no information flows. Information btw is a two folded thing cause the gradient needs to be there &gt; 0 or there is no information.
